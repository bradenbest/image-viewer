# Web Image Viewer by Braden Best

## Version 1.4.2

This userscript is hosted at https://greasyfork.org/scripts/631-image-viewer

Which is synced with this gist.

## Usage

To use this script, inject it into any page, and RIGHT-CLICK on the image you want to view full-size

This can be accomplished by

* visiting the its [greasyfork user-script page](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/631-image-viewer) and installing it
* pasting the code directly into a broswer console.

### Notes

* while the image is "open", you can drag it around to pan instead of scrolling
* There is a close button, and a full URL link above the image
* You can press Esc to close the image without the need for clicking the close button
* You can press Ctrl to re-initialize the script, for when images don't respond to right-clicking

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to Cyberdevil for providing suggestions

* Escape key
* Provide Direct URL to image
* Image should be draggable
* Don't let it interfere with default click events
